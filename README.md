# Particulate Matter and Co-occuring Genetic Risk Induce Oxidative Stress and Cardiac and Brain Alzheimer's

Linear regression models to investigate the relationships between the subset of potential predictors (genotype, exposure, sex, and initial plaque size) and the outcomes of interest in the data. In the settings where repeated measures were present within the data, linear mixed models (LMMs) were utilized to account for the correlation within the subject. Predictors included in each model were selected using a manual backward selection procedure. Each model was assessed for its goodness of fit using diagnostic plots.

Pairwise differences between groups in the linear models to examine post-hoc comparison tests were performed estimating marginal means across different levels of the genotype, exposure, and sex, facilitating the exploration of interaction effects. Tukeyâ€™s adjustment method was implemented to account for multiple comparisons.

The 'Linear Programs' folder contains scripts for reproducing our results for the conducted analyses.
